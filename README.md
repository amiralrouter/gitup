# Gitup

```git add *``` and ```git commit -m ""``` and ```git push``` in one command  

## How is working
Install this app. And call **gitup** command in your directory  


gitup + commit message

```sh

```
or
```sh
> gitup "added new features
```

if you *don't* provide an argument, **"updated"** is used as the commit message

## Installation
